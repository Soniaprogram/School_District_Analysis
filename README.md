# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of Project
Maria, a chief data scientist for a city school district, is responsible for analyzing standardized test scores, preparing all test data for analysis, reporting, and presenting performance trends and patterns. The insights garnered through this analysis will influence discussions and strategic decision making at the school and district level. 

I will be assisting Maria in analyzing student funding and student standardized test scores. With the math and reading scores for each student, along with, school data provided to me, I will aggregate the data and showcase trends in school performance. This analysis will in turn assist the school principal and superintendent make decisions in regards to the school's budget and priorities. I will be using the Pandas Python library along with Jupyter Notebook to inspect the data and perform my analysis. 
Due to evidence of academic dishonesty, specifically reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders, these scores will have to be nulled while keeping the rest of the data intact. This project will go over the analysis changes due to removing these grades. 

## Overview of the school district analysis
### Explain the purpose of this analysis.

## Results
### Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.
How is the district summary affected?
How is the school summary affected?
How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
Math and reading scores by grade
Scores by school spending
Scores by school size
Scores by school type

## Summary
### Summarize four major changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
